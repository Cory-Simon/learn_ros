These are the files that I am using/writing as I learn ROS. Most of this information comes from the official ROS [tutorials](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials) and from the book [A Gentle Introduction to ROS](http://www.cse.sc.edu/~jokane).

I'm not sure if this will be useful to anyone else, but perhaps it is.
